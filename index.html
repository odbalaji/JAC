             <p>Dear Esteemed JAC Members,<br>Greetings to you!</p>
             <p>As I begin my journey as the National Chairman of JAC 2024, I eagerly look forward to the exciting
              path that lies ahead. Our mission is to pave the way for significant change, embodied in the four
              pillars of Reconnecting, Recognising, Rejoicing, and Reflecting</p>
              <p>At the forefront of our priorities is the cultivation of Reconnection among our diverse graduates,
                fortifying the bonds that unite our JAC community. It is imperative that we celebrate the
                achievements of our distinguished alumni, acknowledging the profound impact they have on the
                organisation and the society at large.</p>
